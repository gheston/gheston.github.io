                <p>From 2002 to 2007 I held several overlapping contract positions with Reno-area mining companies, geologists, land managers, geophysicists, economists, and archaeologists. Jobs entailed GIS analysis, data compilation, map production, software training, and image processing. Employed time management skills to juggle multiple clients simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Clients included NewWest Gold, Placer Dome Exploration, and Geologix Explorations.</p>
                <p>At Huffman &amp; Carpenter, a consulting firm specializing in wetlands, hydrology, regulatory compliance, and GIS analysis, I coordinated the mapping activities, including GIS/CAD staff supervision, database development, and system administration, bringing new level of cartographic design, organization, and efficiency to firm. I was involved in the wetland mitigation permitting process, including: proposal, design, construction, monitoring, alternatives analysis, erosion and sediment control procedures (Best Management Practices) for residential, commercial,  and golf course construction projects. I worked with ecologists, botanists, hydrologists, engineers, economists, and attorneys, recommending how geographic digital data can be incorporated into wetlands studies and environmental monitoring projects. I was deposed as an expert witness for court case because of my expertise with GPS, GIS, and aerial photograph interpretation.
