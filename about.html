                <p>From 2002 to 2007 I held several overlapping contract positions with Reno-area mining companies,
                    geologists, land managers, geophysicists, economists, and archaeologists. Jobs entailed GIS
                    analysis, data compilation, map production, software training, and image processing. I employed time
                    management skills to juggle multiple clients simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Clients included NewWest Gold, Placer Dome Exploration, and Geologix Explorations.</p>
                <p>At Huffman &amp; Carpenter, a consulting firm specializing in wetlands, hydrology, regulatory
                    compliance, and GIS analysis, I coordinated the mapping activities, including GIS/CAD staff
                    supervision, database development, and system administration, bringing new level of cartographic
                    design, organization, and efficiency to firm. I was involved in the wetland mitigation permitting
                    process, including: proposal, design, construction, monitoring, alternatives analysis, erosion and
                    sediment control procedures (Best Management Practices) for residential, commercial, and golf course
                    construction projects. I worked with ecologists, botanists, hydrologists, engineers, economists, and
                    attorneys, recommending how geographic digital data can be incorporated into wetlands studies and
                    environmental monitoring projects. I was deposed as an expert witness for court case because of my
